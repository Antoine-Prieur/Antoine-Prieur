## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer & ML Platform Architect** who loves to **actually deploy ML**. My passion lies in bridging the gap between ML research and production systems.

> _"The best ML model is the one running reliably in production, not the one with the highest accuracy on your local machine."_

## ðŸ”­ Current Project: Mood-Aware News Platform

I'm building a **news platform with ML capabilities** that lets you consume news without killing your mood:

- **Sentiment Analysis** - Filter articles by emotional tone
- **Work in Progress** - More features coming soon!
  - **Positivity Filter** - See only uplifting news when you need it
  - **Theme-Based Filtering** - Find articles matching your interests

## ðŸŽ¯ My Ultimate Goal

Creating the **ML platform I'd actually want to work with** - where:

- âœ… Adding new model versions is seamless
- âœ… Production deployments are predictable
- âœ… Rollbacks don't require emergency meetings
- âœ… Monitoring tells you what you need to know
