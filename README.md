## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer & ML Platform Architect** who loves to **actually deploy ML**. My passion lies in bridging the gap between ML research and production systems.

## 🔭 Current Project: Mood-Aware News Platform

I'm building a **news platform with ML capabilities** that lets you consume news without killing your mood:

- **Sentiment Analysis** - Filter articles by emotional tone
- **Work in Progress** - More features coming soon!
  - **Positivity Filter** - See only uplifting news when you need it
  - **Theme-Based Filtering** - Find articles matching your interests

## 🎯 My Objective

Creating the **ML platform I'd actually want to work with** - where:

- Adding new model versions is seamless
- Production deployments are predictable
- Rollbacks don't require emergency meetings
- Monitoring tells you what you need to know
